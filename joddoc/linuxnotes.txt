Linux Specific Notes for JOD 
============================

Before using JOD on linux machines please read these notes.

1. JOD PDF documentation is distributed in the 
   [JODDOCUMENT](http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/Addons/general/joddocument) 
   addon. Install `general/joddocument` to place `jod.pdf` in the directories
   searched by `jodhelp`.

2. JOD source code is distributed in the 
   [JODSOURCE](http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/Addons/general/jodsource) 
   addon. Install `general/jodsource` and run the script:

        ~addons/general/jodsource/jodsourcesetup.ijs 

This script installs the JOD development dictionaries using my recommended path structure.
After running `jodsourcesetup.ijs` you should see directories like: `'john'` is my `$HOME`

        /home/john/jod/j701/joddev
        /home/john/jod/j701/jod
        /home/john/jod/j701/utils
  
To view verbs described in following items these dictionaries must be available.

WARNING: `jodsourcesetup.ijs` uses the `arc/zip` addon. *This addon may fail
on 64 bit J systems.*  See [The JOD Page](http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/the-jod-page)
for a 64 bit system work-around.


### 0.9.75 - June 2012


1. JOD was originally developed on Windows. The port to Linux was
   done on a 32 bit Ubuntu 11.0x system. The only Linux library call
   made by JOD occurs in the `guids` verb. `guids` works on 32 bit Ubuntu 
   Linux machines. It may work on 64 bit Linux as well.  The remaining host
   dependencies derive from shell commands. JOD makes very limited use of 
   Linux shell commands. Shell commands are called primarily to move, rename 
   and copy files. They should work on  any strain of Linux or Unix. 
   However, **JOD has only been tested on 32 bit Ubuntu!**
   
~~~~ { .j }
NB. to view (guids) (install JODSOURCE)
od ;:'joddev jod utils' [ 3 od ''
disp ;:'guids'
~~~~

2. JOD creates host files and directories and assumes it has the necessary
   rights to read, write and move these files. During development I put all my
   JOD dictionaries in my `$HOME` `/home/john` directory`.
   
~~~~ { .j }
NB. to view verbs that manipulate host files (install JODSOURCE)
od ;:'joddev jod utils' [ 3 od ''
disp ;:'renamefiles copyfiles'
~~~~

3. JOD requires rooted dictionary paths, i.e., your paths must begin with a slash `/`.
   This rule matters most when creating and registering dictionaries. For example:

~~~~ { .j }
NB. create a dictionary named (test0) in specified location
newd 'test0';'/home/john/jod/j701/test0';'test0 notes'
  
NB. register an extant dictionary named (test1)
regd 'test1';'/home/john/jod/j701/test1';'test1 notes'
~~~~

4. JOD uses J's configured web browser and pdf reader. Make sure you
   have a browser and reader setup.  

   If you have not configured a J web browser JOD will attempt to use `chromium-browser`
   to browse online help. If you do not have Chrome installed `jodhelp` will
   not work.
   
~~~~ { .j }
NB. od ;:'joddev jod utils' [ 3 od'' NB. required dictionaries
disp 'jodhelp'
~~~~

Similarily JOD will use the `/usr/evince` pdf reader if you have not specified a pdf reader.

5. **DO NOT USE blanks in Linux JOD paths.**  Blanks may produce errors in 
   JOD generated shell commands.  On Windows machines you can enclose blank
   infested paths with double quotes like `"c:\Program Files\"`.  I am not 
   sure how to do something similiar with Linux paths.

6. JOD tests volume space before creating, copying or restoring backups. On Windows
   free disk space is returned by an API call.  On Linux the `df` shell command is used.
   The `df` command returns free space for all mounted volumes.  I only need the volume
   that contains JOD dictionary files but I do not know how to determine the volume
   name from a linux file path.  Hence I return the smallest amount of free space for 
   all mounted volumes.  See the JOD `freedisk` verb for details. If you have really
   small volumes mounted JOD may refuse to create, backup or restore dictionaries.

~~~~ { .j }
NB. od ;:'joddev jod utils' [ 3 od'' NB. required dictionaries
disp 'freedisk'
~~~~~
