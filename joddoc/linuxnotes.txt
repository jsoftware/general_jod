Linux Specific Notes for JOD 0.9.2 (May 2011)

This is the first Linux compatible version of JOD. Before using
JOD on linux machines please read these notes.

1) JOD source code is distributed in the JODSOURCE addon. Install the 
JODSOURCE addon and run the script:

  ~addons/general/jodsource/jodsourcesetup.ijs 

This script installs the JOD development dictionaries using my recommended path structure.
After running (jodsourcesetup.ijs) you should see directories like: ('john' is my $HOME)

  /home/john/jod/j701/joddev
  /home/john/jod/j701/jod
  /home/john/jod/j701/utils
  
To view verbs described in following items these dictionaries must be available.

2) JOD was originally developed on Windows. The port to Linux was
done on a 32 bit Ubuntu 11.0x system. The only Linux library call
made by JOD occurs in the (guids) verb. 

  NB. to view (guids) (install JODSOURCE item 1)
  od ;:'joddev jod utils' [ 3 od ''
  disp ;:'guids'

(guids) works fine on 32 bit Ubuntu Linux machines. It may work on 64 bit 
Linux as well.  The remaining host dependencies derive from shell commands. 
JOD makes very limited use of Linux shell commands. Shell commands are 
called primarily to move, rename and copy files. They should work on 
any strain of Linux or Unix. However, JOD has only been tested on 32 bit Ubuntu!

3) JOD creates host files and directories and assumes it has the necessary
rights to read, write and move these files. During development I put all my
JOD dictionaries in my $HOME (/home/john) directory.

  NB. to view verbs that manipulate host files (install JODSOURCE item 1)
  od ;:'joddev jod utils' [ 3 od ''
  disp ;:'renamefiles copyfiles'

4) JOD requires rooted dictionary paths, i.e., your paths must begin with a slash /.

5) JOD uses J's configured web browser and pdf reader. Make sure you
have a browser and reader setup.  

If you have not configured a J web browser JOD will attempt to use chromium-browser
to browse online help. If you do not have Chrome installed (jodhelp) will
not work.
   
   NB. od ;:'joddev jod utils' [ 3 od'' NB. required dictionaries
   disp 'jodhelp'

Similarily JOD will use the /usr/evince pdf reader if you have not specified a pdf reader.

5) DO NOT USE blanks in Linux JOD paths.  Blanks may produce errors in 
JOD generated shell commands.  On Windows machines you can enclose blank
infested paths with double quotes like "c:\Program Files\".  I am not sure how to
do something similiar with Linux paths.

6) JOD tests volume space before creating, copying or restoring backups. On Windows
free disk space is returned by an API call.  On Linux the (df) shell command is used.
The df command returns free space for all mounted volumes.  I only need the volume
that contains JOD dictionary files but I do not know how to determine the volume
name from a linux file path.  Hence I return the smallest amount of free space for 
all mounted volumes.  See the JOD (freedisk) verb for details. If you have really
small volumes mounted JOD may refuse to create, backup or restore dictionaries.

  NB. od ;:'joddev jod utils' [ 3 od'' NB. required dictionaries
  disp 'freedisk'
