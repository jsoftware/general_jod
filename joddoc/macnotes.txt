Mac Specific Notes for JOD
==========================

This is the first Mac compatible version of JOD.
Before using JOD on Mac machines please read these notes.

1. JOD PDF documentation is distributed in the 
   [JODDOCUMENT](http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/Addons/general/joddocument) 
   addon. Install `general/joddocument` to place `jod.pdf` in the directories
   searched by `jodhelp`.

2. JOD source code is distributed in the 
   [JODSOURCE](http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/Addons/general/jodsource) 
   addon. Install `general/jodsource` and run the script:

        ~addons/general/jodsource/jodsourcesetup.ijs 

This script installs the JOD development dictionaries using my recommended path structure.
After running `jodsourcesetup.ijs` you should see directories like: 

        /Users/john/jod/j701/joddev
        /Users/john/jod/j701/jod
        /Users/john/jod/j701/utils
  
To view verbs described in following items these dictionaries must be available.

WARNING: `jodsourcesetup.ijs` uses the `arc/zip` addon. *This addon may fail
on 64 bit J systems.*  See [The JOD Page](http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/the-jod-page)
for a 64 bit system work-around.


### 0.9.75 - June 2012

1. JOD was originally developed on Windows. The Mac port was
   done on a 32 bit Intel Mac Pro. The only Mac library call
   made by JOD occurs in the `guids` verb. 
   `guids` works fine on 32 bit Mac machines. It may work on 64 bit 
   Macs as well.  The remaining host dependencies derive from shell commands. 
   JOD makes very limited use of Mac shell commands. Shell commands are 
   called to move, rename and copy files. They should work on 
   any Mac. However, JOD has only been tested on 32 bit Intel Macs!

~~~~ { .j }
NB. to view (guids) (install JODSOURCE)
od ;:'joddev jod utils' [ 3 od ''
disp ;:'guids'
~~~~

2. JOD creates host files and directories and assumes it has the necessary
   rights to read, write and move these files. During development I put all my
   JOD dictionaries in my home `/Users/john` directory.
 
~~~~{ .j }
  NB. to view verbs that manipulate host files (install JODSOURCE)
  od ;:'joddev jod utils' [ 3 od ''
  disp ;:'renamefiles copyfiles'
~~~~

3. Mac JOD requires rooted dictionary paths, i.e., your paths must begin with a slash `/`.
   This rule matters most when creating and registering dictionaries. For example:

~~~~{ .j }
NB. create a dictionary named (test0) in specified location
newd 'test0';'/Users/john/jod/j701/test0';'test0 notes'

NB. register an extant dictionary named (test1)
regd 'test1';'/Users/john/jod/j701/test1';'test1 notes'
~~~~

4. The Mac version of JOD uses the shell command "open" to browse
   URLs and read PDF documents.  Mac JOD ignores the J configured 
   browser and PDF reader. This limitation might be relaxed if 
   it proves annoying.

5. **DO NOT USE blanks in Mac JOD paths.** This is an annoying restriction
   that I will relax in later versions. Blanks may produce errors in 
   JOD generated shell commands.  On Windows machines you can enclose blank
   infested paths with double quotes like `"c:\Program Files\"`.  I am not 
   sure how to do something similiar with Mac paths.

6. JOD tests volume space before creating, copying or restoring backups. On Windows
   free disk space is returned by an API call.  On Mac's disk space is
   currently ignored. You will need at least 2mb of free space to create, move
   or copy JOD dictionaries. Mind you if you only have 2mb free most of your 
   Mac software will stop working anyway.
