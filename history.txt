general/jod - change history
============================

### 0.9.85 - October 13, 2012

 * `jodliterate` group added. See `2 9 disp 'jodliterate'`
   and the blog post [Semi-Literate
   JOD](http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2012/10/01/semi-literate-jod/) 
   for details

 * `MARKDOWN` macro text code 27 added.
   
 * `5 disp ''` now displays any overall put dictionary documentation.
 
 *  minor `jod.pdf` edits and additions.
 
 * Starting the process of converting most JOD document 
   text to [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) 
   including this document.[^1]

### 0.9.80 - July 12, 2012

 * dictionary documents set and fetched with `5 put 'doc ...'`
   and `5 get ''` are now saved in dump scripts. `5 put '..'` 
   is controlled by a new parameter `jodparms.ijs` `DOCUMENTDICT`
   that determines whether `5 put 'doc ..'` stores text. The
   default `DOCUMENTDICT=1` stores text.

 * vestigial `z` locale dump script load utilities `sonl_z_,
   SOLOCALE_z_, soput_z_` and `soclear_z_` are now erased at the
   end of dump script runs. JOD defines exactly four words
   in the z locale: `jodoff_z_, jodon_z_, jodsystempath_z_`
   and `showpass_z_`.

 * `opendict` has been modified to test whether master
   file paths are prefixes of stored dictionary paths. For 
   `READWRITE` dictionaries the prefix must match. For `READONLY`
   dictionaries the master path replaces the stored path in
   dictionary directory objects if they differ. This allows 
   `READONLY` dictionaries to be placed on locked down network 
   drives and accessed by many users that may have different 
   access paths.  
   
 * DEPENDS sections added to JOD and JODSOURCE manifest scripts.
 
 * `jod.pdf` (general/joddocument addon) updated.

### 0.9.75 - June 26, 2012

 * first Mac compatible version of JOD. The Mac version
   requires J 7.01 or beyond see: 

        ~addons/general/jod/joddoc/macnotes.txt
   
 * `jod.pdf` updated and now distributed as a
   separate JAL addon. Install `general/joddocument`
   to place `jod.pdf` in the directories searched
   by `jodhelp`. `jodhelp` no longer looks for an
   online version of `jod.pdf`. 
   
 * fixed a `disp` length error. 
 
 * line ends in all script files set to line feed LF
 
 * labs updated for J 7.01 and Linux/Mac versions
 
 * lab `jodprjm.ijt` removed - this lab referred
   to an old (pre 7.01) project manager. 
  
### 0.9.7 - Jan 16, 2011

 * `jodfork` now calls `fork_jtask_` - done to handle change
   in main J library. `task` verbs are no longer loaded to `z` locale

### 0.9.65 - Dec 19, 2011

 * `get, put` now fetch and set put dictionary documentation.
 
        5 get '' 
        5 put 'document this dictionary' 

### 0.9.6 - Dec 12, 2011

 * `jodhelp` pointed to new online version of `jod.pdf`
   EPS, TEX and HTML document files removed from main jod dictionary
   to reduce the size of `jodsource.zip`. These files
   are available in the online JOD svn repository. 
   See [The JOD Page](http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/the-jod-page/).
   
 * `compj` can now be limited to only white space removal by 
   inserting the comment tag `(-.)=:` anywhere in the text of
   an explicit word.
   
### 0.9.5 - Dec 4, 2011

 * fixed a `make` bug in `dumpwords` a path of all
   empty dictionaries failed to make.
   
 * fixed an `mls` bug that produced incorrect 
   JOD `startup.ijs` entries on Linux.
   
 * more test cases added.

### 0.9.4 - Nov 25, 2011

 * update `jodindex.html` to reference current online documentation
 
 * fixed a `make` bug - `make` could fail when words with the
   the same name and different name classes were present on
   the path.
   
 * updating and extending JOD tests.
   
### 0.9.3 - Jun 11, 2011

 * online documentation revised and extended. The online documents
   are hosted by Google Documents and can be read on the web or
   downloaded in a variety of formats: PDF, ODT, Word, HTML. The
   offline `jod.pdf` will be revised after collecting user feedback.

### 0.9.2 - May 29, 2011

 * first Linux compatible version of JOD. The Linux version
   requires J 7.01 or beyond see: 

        ~addons/general/jod/joddoc/linuxnotes.txt

 * online documentation, available via the verb `jodhelp`,
   has been converted to the new Google Document format. 
   The conversion process broke all the internal hyperlinks
   I am slowly fixing them. The offline PDF document 
   [`jod.pdf`](http://www.box.net/shared/gajfu50gc0)
   does not show Linux specific examples but is still
   an accurate description of what JOD is all about.

 * additional information about JOD will be made
   available on [my blog](http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com)
   after a round of beta testing in the wild.  

 * this version of JOD runs on windows J 6.0x and J 7.0x systems.
  
### 0.9.1 - May 7, 2011

 * minor fix of edit verb `et` to run on both 7.0x and 6.0x J systems.

### 0.9.0 - Feb 18, 2011

 * modified to run under J 7.01 JHS and JGTK. This version
   also runs on J 6.0x systems.
   
 * replaced JOD's `z` locale interface with an `ijod` interface.
   JOD now defines only three words: `jodon, jodoff` and 
   `jodsystempath` in the `z` locale.  All other interface
   words are defined in `ijod` which is placed on the
   base locale's search path
   
 * path and file displays converted to `jpathsep` conventions.
 
 * `jod.pdf` removed from the core JOD addon package.  `jod.pdf`
   was by far the largest part of the core install package. `jod.pdf`
   is now browsed on-line by `jodhelp`. You can download `jod.pdf`
   and place it in `~addons/general/jod/joddoc/pdfdoc/` to enable
   local PDF reading.
   
 * online JOD documentation updated to reflect changes.
 
 * `UTF8` macro script code changed from 26 to 28 (remember 28 for `UTF8`).
 
 * `BYTE` macro script code added with value 26.  
 
### 0.8.0 - Oct 31, 2008

 * added new `jodparms.ijs` parameter `ASCII85` that controls whether
   dump files use ascii85 for text objects.  Default is 0.
   The ascii85 representation generally produces smaller 
   dump files but is slower than the default method.
   
 * `jodsource` uses ascii85 for JOD development dictionaries to 
   reduce the size of the downloads.
   
 * minor fixes in `jod.pdf`

### 0.7.3 - Oct 7, 2008

 * forced path comparisons to lower case in JOD Lab #4 and test `'setup_jodproject'`
 
 * fixed a few typos in `jod.pdf`

### 0.7.2 - Sep 25, 2008

 * completed dyadic case of `doc`
 
 * updated `jod.pdf` to describe changes

### 0.7.1 - Sep 24, 2008

 * removed some large EPS files from dictionary to reduce download size
 
 * replaced JOD directory diagram in `jod.pdf` - reduces size of j`od.pdf`

### 0.7.0 - Sep 24, 2008

 * references added to `jod.pdf `
 
 * new jod hardcopy [www.lulu.com](http://www.lulu.com) edition
 
### 0.6.0 - Aug 18, 2008

 * minor jod script edits
 
 * `jod.pdf` index improved 
 
### 0.5.1 - Jul 21, 2008

 * `joduserconfig.ijs` added
 
 * `gdeps` now documented in `jod.pdf`
 
### 0.5.0 - Jul 18, 2008

 * `jod.pdf` documentation complete
 
### 0.4.0 - Jul 10, 2008

 * insure at least one group in `joddevload` for lab
 
 * minor lab edits - refer to `startup.ijs` instead of `scripts.ijs`
 
### 0.3.8 - May 31, 2008

 * minor update to last lab section

### 0.3.7 - May 31, 2008

 * bug fixes in labs - all labs can be run

### 0.3.6 - May 29, 2008

 * first release of fully "addon-ized" JOD - versions prior
   to this release had to be manually installed by 
   ad-hoc scripts. Now the JAL system handles JOD installs.
