general/jod - change history

== 0.9.1 ==
 * minor fix of edit verb (et) to run on both 7.0x and 6.0x J systems.

== 0.9.0 ==
 * modified to run under J 7.01 JHS and JGTK. This version
   also runs on J 6.0x systems.
 * replaced JOD's (z) locale interface with an (ijod) interface.
   JOD now defines only three words: (jodon), (jodoff) and 
   (jodsystempath) in the (z) locale.  All other interface
   words are defined in (ijod) which is placed on the
   base locale's search path
 * path and file displays converted to (jpathsep) conventions.
 * jod.pdf removed from the core JOD addon package.  jod.pdf
   was by far the largest part of the core install package. jod.pdf
   is now browsed on-line by (jodhelp). You can download jod.pdf
   and place it in ~addons/general/jod/joddoc/pdfdoc/ to enable
   local PDF reading.
 * online JOD documentation updated to reflect changes.
 * UTF8 macro script code changed from 26 to 28 (remember 28 for UTF8).
 * BYTE macro script code added with value 26.  
 
== 0.8.0 ==
 * added new jodparms.ijs parameter ASCII85 that controls whether
   dump files use ascii85 for text objects.  Default is 0.
   The ascii85 representation generally produces smaller 
   dump files but is slower than the default method.
 * jodsource uses ascii85 for JOD development dictionaries to 
   reduce the size of the downloads.
 * minor fixes in jod.pdf

== 0.7.3 ==
 * forced path comparisons to lower case in JOD Lab #4 and test 'setup_jodproject'
 * fixed a few typos in jod.pdf

== 0.7.2 ==
 * completed dyadic case of doc
 * updated jod.pdf to describe changes

== 0.7.1 ==
 * removed some large EPS files from dictionary to reduce download size
 * replaced JOD directory diagram in jod.pdf - reduces size of jod.pdf
