general/jod - change history

== 0.9.7 == Jan 16, 2011
 * (jodfork) now calls (fork_jtask_) - done to handle change
   in main J library. (task) verbs are no longer loaded to z locale

== 0.9.65 == Dec 19, 2011
 * (get,put) now fetch and set put dictionary documentation.
   5 get '' 
   5 put 'document this dictionary' 

== 0.9.6 == Dec 12, 2011
 * (jodhelp) pointed to new online version of (jod.pdf)
   EPS, TEX and HTML document files removed from main jod dictionary
   to reduce the size of jodsource.zip. These files
   are available in the online JOD svn repository. See The JOD Page.
 * (compj) can now be limited to only white space removal by 
   inserting the comment tag (-.)=: anywhere in the text of
   an explicit word.
   
== 0.9.5 == Dec 4, 2011
 * fixed a (make) bug in (dumpwords) a path of all
   empty dictionaries failed to make.
 * fixed an (mls) bug that produced incorrect
   JOD startup.ijs entries on Linux.
 * more test cases added.

== 0.9.4 == Nov 25, 2011
 * update jodindex.html to reference current online documentation
 * fixed a (make) bug - make could fail when words with the
   the same name and different name classes were present on
   the path.
 * updating and extending JOD tests.
   
== 0.9.3 == Jun 11, 2011
 * online documentation revised and extended. The online documents
   are hosted by Google Documents and can be read on the web or
   downloaded in a variety of formats: PDF, ODT, Word, HTML. The
   offline jod.pdf will be revised after collecting user feedback.

== 0.9.2 == May 29, 2011
 * first Linux compatible version of JOD. The Linux version
   requires J 7.01 or beyond see: 

   ~addons/general/jod/joddoc/linuxnotes.txt

 * online documentation, available via the verb (jodhelp),
   has been converted to the new Google Document format. 
   The conversion process broke all the internal hyperlinks
   I am slowly fixing them. The offline PDF document (jod.pdf)

   http://www.box.net/shared/gajfu50gc0

   does not show Linux specific examples but is still
   an accurate description of what JOD is all about.

 * additional information about JOD will be made
   available on my blog after a round of beta testing 
   in the wild.

 * this version of JOD runs on windows J 6.0x and J 7.0x systems.
  
== 0.9.1 == May 7, 2011
 * minor fix of edit verb (et) to run on both 7.0x and 6.0x J systems.

== 0.9.0 == Feb 18, 2011
 * modified to run under J 7.01 JHS and JGTK. This version
   also runs on J 6.0x systems.
 * replaced JOD's (z) locale interface with an (ijod) interface.
   JOD now defines only three words: (jodon), (jodoff) and 
   (jodsystempath) in the (z) locale.  All other interface
   words are defined in (ijod) which is placed on the
   base locale's search path
 * path and file displays converted to (jpathsep) conventions.
 * jod.pdf removed from the core JOD addon package.  jod.pdf
   was by far the largest part of the core install package. jod.pdf
   is now browsed on-line by (jodhelp). You can download jod.pdf
   and place it in ~addons/general/jod/joddoc/pdfdoc/ to enable
   local PDF reading.
 * online JOD documentation updated to reflect changes.
 * UTF8 macro script code changed from 26 to 28 (remember 28 for UTF8).
 * BYTE macro script code added with value 26.  
 
== 0.8.0 == Oct 31, 2008
 * added new jodparms.ijs parameter ASCII85 that controls whether
   dump files use ascii85 for text objects.  Default is 0.
   The ascii85 representation generally produces smaller 
   dump files but is slower than the default method.
 * jodsource uses ascii85 for JOD development dictionaries to 
   reduce the size of the downloads.
 * minor fixes in jod.pdf

== 0.7.3 == Oct 7, 2008
 * forced path comparisons to lower case in JOD Lab #4 and test 'setup_jodproject'

   ad-hoc scripts. Now the JAL system handles JOD installs.
